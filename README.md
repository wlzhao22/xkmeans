# xkmeans
This is a pure C++ implementation about a dozens of k-means variants and the original k-means.

The performance evaluation and the details of our proposals of k-means variants, such as k-means#, k-sums, and sequential-k-sums can be found from our papers.

#The k-means variants that are inluded in this project are as follows.
###k-means
###k-means++
###mini-Batch
###hartigan method
###k-means^#
###graph-based k-means
###sequential k-means
###sequential k-sums
###The bisecting version of above k-means variants have been also integrated.
