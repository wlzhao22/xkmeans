# xkmeans
This is a pure C++ implementation about a dozens of k-means variants and the original k-means.

The performance evaluation and the details of our proposals of k-means variants, such as k-means#, k-sums, and sequential-k-sums can be found from our papers.

# The k-means variants that are inluded in this project are as follows.
### k-means
### k-means++
### mini-Batch
### hartigan method
### k-means^# (our propoal, see paper [1])
### graph-based k-means (our proposal, see paper [3])
### sequential k-means
### sequential k-sums (our proposal, see paper [2])
### The bisecting version of above k-means variants have been also integrated.
